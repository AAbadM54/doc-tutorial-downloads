These are the example files for the IBM Watson Visual Recognition Service [tutorials](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/visual-recognition/tutorials.shtml) documentation page. 

To begin working with the Watson Visual Recognition Service files, follow these steps:

1. Get credentials for the service from [Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/visual-recognition/), and download cURL.
2. Use the default classifier to classify the sample file `fruitbowl.jpg`.
3. Try out detecting faces using the sample file `prez.jpg`.
4. Detect text in an image using the sample file `sign.jpg`.
5. Create your own custom classifier by using the sample compressed folders`husky.zip`, `golden-retriever.zip`, `beagle.zip`, and `cats.zip`.
6. Retrain the classifier that you created in step 5 by using the sample compressed folders `dalmatian.zip`, and `more-cats.zip`.
7. Test out the classifier you created by using the sample file `dog.jpg`.

For more information about any of these steps, check out the full [Visual Recognition tutorial](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/doc/visual-recognition/tutorials.shtml) in the documentation.
